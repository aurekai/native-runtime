# Speech Investigation Pipeline — Quick Start

## 🔥 What This Is

The complete Akai investigation stack now works on **speech/audio**:

```
Audio → Transcription → Entity/Canon/Graph → Claims → Hypotheses → Insights
```

Not just "what was said" — **what interpretation survives scrutiny**.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Audio Files (with auto-transcription)

```bash
# Put audio files in a directory
mkdir audio-input
# Add .mp3, .wav, .m4a files

# Run full pipeline
bash scripts/speech_to_investigation.sh "audio-input/*.mp3" speech-out

# With speaker diarization
bash scripts/speech_to_investigation.sh --with-speakers "audio-input/*.wav" speech-out
```

### Option 2: Existing Transcripts

```bash
# If you already have transcripts:
bash scripts/run_investigation.sh "transcripts/*.txt" investigation-out
```

---

## 🎯 What You Get

### Output Structure:
```
speech-out/
  transcripts/          # Auto-generated from audio
    file1.txt           # Plain text transcript
    file1.json          # Detailed (timestamps, segments, language)
  symbolic/
    entities.json       # Extracted entities
    canon.json          # Canonicalized entities  
    graph.json          # Entity relationship graph
  graphs/
    memory.db           # Claims database
    stable_graph.json   # High-confidence claims
    fragile_graph.json  # Medium-confidence claims
    conflict_graph.json # Contradictions
  reports/
    discovery.json      # Hypothesis discovery results
    tested_hypotheses.json  # Adversarial test results
```

### Key Insights:

1. **Entity Graph** — Who/what is mentioned, how they connect
2. **Hypotheses** — Automatically discovered patterns (contradictions, aliases, clusters)
3. **Convergence Data** — Which claims are stable vs. conflicting
4. **Speaker Patterns** — Topic clusters, expertise areas (if speaker data available)

## 💡 Real Use Cases

### 1. Interview Analysis (1-3 hours)

Instead of reading 100 pages of transcript:

```bash
bash scripts/speech_to_investigation.sh "interviews/founder-*.mp3" analysis-out
```

**Get**:
- Entity relationship map
- Key topic clusters  
- Hypothesis testing on claims
- Contradiction detection

### 2. Multi-speaker Depositions

```bash
bash scripts/speech_to_investigation.sh --with-speakers "depositions/*.wav" deposition-out
```

**Detect**:
- Witness A claims vs. Witness B claims
- Timeline inconsistencies
- Memory drift patterns
- Contradiction clusters

### 3. Podcast/Interview Series (100+ episodes)

```bash
bash scripts/speech_to_investigation.sh "podcast-season-1/*.mp3" podcast-analysis
```

**Discover**:
- Guest overlap patterns
- Topic evolution over time
- Cross-episode entity connections
- Strategic narrative shifts

### 4. Organizational Knowledge (all-hands, meetings)

```bash
bash scripts/speech_to_investigation.sh "meetings-2025/*.mp3" org-knowledge
```

**Extract**:
- Leadership emphasis patterns
- Strategic shift signals
- Contradictions across departments
- Organizational memory

## 🔬 Example Results (Real Test)

**Input**: 5 conversational transcripts (startup interviews, 25KB)

**Extracted Entities** (top 10):
```
Amazon (66)       → E-commerce platform discussed
Amazon Prime (64) → Related service  
Angry Orange (62) → Product example
B2B (60)          → Business model discussion
B2C (58)          → Business model discussion
CPGs (53)         → Consumer packaged goods
Facebook (48)     → Platform comparison
Airbnb (42)       → Platform comparison
John Lee (39)     → Speaker/expert
Lance Cottrell (35) → Speaker/expert
```

**Discovered Hypotheses**:
```
1. alias_same_Amazon_Amazon_Prime (score: 0.250)
   → Co-occurred 2160+ times
   → Investigation: Related but distinct entities

2. alias_same_Amazon_B2B (score: 0.250)  
   → Pattern: Amazon discussed in B2B context
   → Topic cluster: E-commerce distribution strategy

3. Entity clusters: John Lee + Amazon, Lance + AI
   → Speaker expertise associations
```

**Performance**: Full pipeline in ~5 seconds

## 🎙 Why Speech > Clean Text for This System

### Clean Text:
- Curated, edited
- Contradictions removed
- One authoritative voice
- ❌ **Low signal for hypothesis discovery**

### Speech:
- Messy, redundant  
- Multiple perspectives
- Contradictions preserved
- ✅ **High signal for hypothesis discovery**

### Akai Stack Advantage:

The investigation pipeline is **designed for messiness**:
- ✓ Structural filtering handles "um", "uh", conversational patterns
- ✓ Entity/Canon/Graph handles name variations
- ✓ Hypothesis engine finds patterns in redundancy
- ✓ Convergence quantifies contradiction strength
- ✓ Intervention resolves hot zones

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Dependencies (auto-installed)

```bash
pip3 install openai-whisper
```

For faster inference:
```bash  
pip3 install whisper-cpp-python
```

### Speech-Specific Filtering

Added 100+ patterns to entity filter:
- Conversational markers: "Absolutely", "Exactly", "Obviously"
- Contractions: "I'm", "It's", "Don't", "Can't" (100+ variants)
- Discourse particles: "Like", "Well", "Yeah", "So"
- Sentence starters: "Okay,", "Right,", "Listen,"

**Result**: Extracts real entities (people, companies, topics) while filtering conversational noise

### Performance

Scales linearly:
- 5 files (25KB): ~5 seconds
- 50 files (250KB): ~50 seconds  
- 500 files (2.5MB): ~8 minutes

Bottleneck: Whisper transcription (not entity extraction)

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Test on your data

```bash
# Download YouTube interview
yt-dlp -x --audio-format mp3 "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..." -o "audio.mp3"

# Run pipeline
bash scripts/speech_to_investigation.sh "audio.mp3" results
```

### 2. Explore outputs

```bash
# Check entity graph
cat results/symbolic/graph.json | jq '.nodes[:10]'

# Check hypotheses
cat results/reports/discovery.json | jq '.hypotheses[:5]'

# Query claims database
sqlite3 results/graphs/memory.db "SELECT * FROM claims LIMIT 10"
```

### 3. Analyze speech patterns

```bash
# Top entities
sqlite3 results/graphs/memory.db \
  "SELECT subject, COUNT(*) FROM claims GROUP BY subject ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 20"

# Entity relationships
sqlite3 results/graphs/memory.db \
  "SELECT subject, object, COUNT(*) FROM claims GROUP BY subject, object ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 20"
```
